%        This paper identifies a research problem within the area of model-based high-performance embedded systems, and defines research goals to be achieved in hopes of providing a
%		solution to the outlined problem. This paper also provides a review of autonomic computing and its history through several related areas of research
%		in order to provide justification for the proposal of new research. Following the literature
%		review is a brief summary of the relevant efforts noting where research is
%		lacking with respect to the identified problem. This summary forms the justification for new
%		research needed to solve the identified problem. After the problem has been identified and the research effort
%		justified, a plan of action is proposed which outlines the methods and procedures to be taken
%		during the course of the research, identifying several research milestones which will ultimately
%		serve as the completion criteria for the fulfillment of the doctoral degree.
