  abstract = {Software testing is one of the most important techniques to validate
	software and reduce potential risk. However, software testing is
	a labor-consuming process, typically consuming at least 50% of the
	total costs of developing software. The most labor-intensive component
	in software testing is the generation of test data, which consumes
	at least 40% of the total testing costs. Thus, the automation of
	test data generation is a promising way to drastically reduce the
	cost. Most of existing approaches of automatic test data generation
	are concentrated on the programs written in simple languages using
	simple test adequacy criterion. This thesis addresses the empirical
	studies of application of four optimization techniques on the test
	data generation. Condition-decision coverage is used in the experiments.
	Empirical results on five C/C++ programs are provided in this thesis,
	as well as the detailed analysis and discussion of the performance
	of these optimization methods.},
